## Overview

In this project, I developed a chatbot integrated with the ChatGPT 3.5 API. Using Next.js for front-end development and Vercel V0 Dev for user interface design, I created a complete application spanning both the front end and back end. The project highlights the innovative use of AI-powered code assistance tools to streamline development and enhance functionality.
## Key Features

- User-Friendly Interface: Designed a simple, intuitive interface that allows clients or businesses to easily create and customize their own chatbots without requiring advanced technical knowledge.
- Streamlined Integration: Developed seamless functionality to connect user-created chatbots with the ChatGPT 3.5 API, enabling natural and dynamic conversations tailored to their needs.
- Effortless Deployment: Implemented a straightforward workflow using GitHub and Vercel for fast, reliable deployment, ensuring the app is ready to use with minimal setup.
- Customizability: Provided options for users to input their ChatGPT API keys and personalize chatbot behavior, offering flexibility to suit diverse business needs.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: For building a responsive and dynamic front end.
- Vercel V0 Dev: For designing the user interface and deploying the application.
- GitHub: To manage version control and collaboration during development.
- ChatGPT API: For enabling chatbot functionality


## Challenges and Learnings

One of the challenges was ensuring the interface was simple enough for non-technical users while maintaining robust functionality. Overcoming this required iterative testing and refining the design for usability. Additionally, integrating the ChatGPT API in a way that allowed users to easily manage their API keys was a key learning experience, improving the appâ€™s accessibility and practicality.
## Outcome

The project resulted in a fully functional, user-friendly chatbot creation platform that simplifies AI adoption for businesses. It enables clients to develop and deploy their own chatbots efficiently, enhancing customer engagement and operational productivity.
